Our project is based on 
                  -  a wearable device which basically measures vital data like temperature,spo2 level and pulse rate of a patient admitted in hospital and further                       shares this data to firebase realtime database.
                  - and a mobile app which fetches this data from firebase similarly of many patients and gives a priority order that a doctor should make to visit                them. And this order is based on their spo2 and temperature values.
